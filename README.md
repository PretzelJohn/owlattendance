A client asked for a web application that would help manage student event attendance records at KSU. My client no longer needs the web app, so they authorized me to add it to my portfolio.

This is the resulting web app, built using the Python Flask web framework. It can be deployed in the cloud, such as Azure or Heroku.

The front end uses Bootstrap, but everything else was coded by hand. The back end uses Python Flask, SQLAlchemy, and a few other Python modules to handle page routing and report generation.
